-- In this database, I queried an international store database to find out top performing products and locations, and categorize customers.

#1. Which countries averaged a price of more than 2000 per customer?

SELECT country,
ROUND(AVG(price)) as avg_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY country
HAVING avg_price > 2000;

#2. Categorize each customer by amount they've spent at the store.

SELECT name, price,
    CASE
        WHEN price < 2000
            THEN "Casual Customer"
        WHEN price > 3000 AND price < 7000
            THEN "Serious Customer"
        ELSE "VIP Customer"
        END as "customer_category"
FROM sales
ORDER BY customer_category DESC;

#3. Which product(s) grossed more than 100,000?

SELECT product, SUM(price) as total_sum
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
HAVING total_sum > 100000;
