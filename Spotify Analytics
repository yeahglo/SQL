# For this project, I downloaded a Spotify dataset from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to import that Spotify dataset.
# From there, I was able to analyze the dataset using SQL.

# Using SQL, I created this table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

# Then I imported the Spotify csv file into the table

# After that, I explored the dataset using the following SQL queries.

# 1. Who were the top ten artists by popularity and what was their average tempo and energy?

SELECT artist_name,
popularity,
AVG(tempo),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

# 2. What was the speechiest track?

SELECT MAX(speechiness), track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

# 3. What was the most common key used for all songs?

SELECT song_key,
COUNT(song_key) as times_used
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY song_key
ORDER BY times_used DESC
LIMIT 1

# 4. What was the longest song?

SELECT MAX(duration_ms),
track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

# 5. Which artists have the word "The" in their name?

SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name LIKE '%The%'

# 6. List out all the tracks that had zero instrumentalness, along with their artist name and popularity.

SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE instrumentalness = 0.0
GROUP BY track_name, artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC

# 7. Which three artists had the most songs on the list?

SELECT COUNT(track_name) as total_tracks,
artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY total_tracks DESC
LIMIT 3
