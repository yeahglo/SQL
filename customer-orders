#In this project, I'm querying a database with customer and order information to quantify items sold across several months.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order_ID'


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT
product,
price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?.

SELECT product,
SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101? How many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product,
SUM(quantity) as total_sold,
SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum) feb_total_cust,
AVG(Quantity*Price) avg_amt
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'


#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT DISTINCT product,
sum(quantity) as total_qty
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY product ASC


#8. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT location,
COUNT(orderID) total_orders

WHERE location like '%NY%'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING total_orders > 2


#9. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT DISTINCT product,
SUM(quantity) as total
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%Headphone%'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product


#10. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT SUM(quantity*price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) as avg_amt
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#11. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT SUM(feb.quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) as avg_amt
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#12. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product,
SUM(quantity*price) as revenue
